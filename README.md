# chess.com-api-project
This is a small project that I made using the Chess.com API

I made a YouTube video series of me making this project. You can check it out here: https://youtu.be/NQ7_-7GyTUM
Part 2 of the series here: https://youtu.be/oDXvMUFAjCw

You can read the API docs here: https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api

The website is live on the internet! You can check it out here: https://dseanhd.github.io/chess.com-api-project/

# Changes wanted
- Change the color of the text, something other than black
- Make the text of the area that shows the username, followers, country, league and url bigger
- Make the site responsive, currently, it does not display well on mobile devices. Making it responsive and aligning everything centre would be nice
