# chess.com-api-project
This is a small project that I made using the Chess.com API

I made a YouTube video series of me making this project. You can check it out here: https://youtu.be/NQ7_-7GyTUM
Part 2 of the series here: https://youtu.be/oDXvMUFAjCw

You can read the API docs here: https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api
